# RAR Systems Group

Independent analysis of advertising platform enforcement systems, trust signals, and account stability failures.

## Purpose
This repository documents recurring patterns observed across major advertising platforms where legitimate businesses experience account suspensions, payment trust issues, policy restrictions, or unexplained delivery failures.

The focus is on understanding *how* enforcement systems behave at a structural level, rather than offering platform-specific support or promotional services.

## Focus Areas
- Google Ads account suspensions and restrictions
- Billing, payments, and trust profile failures
- Policy enforcement edge cases and false positives
- System-level risks affecting long-running advertiser accounts
- Stability challenges faced by agencies and client-managed accounts

## Intended Audience
Business owners, consultants, agencies, and operators who rely on paid media platforms and are impacted by opaque enforcement or trust-related disruptions.

## Scope & Notes
- This repository reflects independent analysis and observed patterns
- It is not affiliated with Google or any advertising platform
- Content here is informational and analytical in nature
- No confidential or proprietary platform data is included

## Status
Actively maintained as new patterns and enforcement behaviors emerge.
